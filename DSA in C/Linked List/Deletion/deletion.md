# There are basically 4 ways of deletion in a Linked List 
        1. In the beginning ---- O(1)
        2. At the end   ---- O(N)
        3. In between   ---- O(N)
        4. A node whose data is given ---- O(1) because the pointer of the previous node will be given so we dont need to traverse all Nodes
